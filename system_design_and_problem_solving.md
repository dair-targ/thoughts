# System Design and Problem Solving

It was a little amazement for me to learn the commonality in approach to
algorithmic problems and to system design.
Despite I already knew all the individual steps in order to approach any of them,
today I encountered a straightforward methodology turning those sparse and chaotic steps
into a streamlined process.

Here are the steps of the process:
1. Determine requirements and constraints.
1. Outline possible high-level approaches.
1. Understand bottle-necks. In case of algorithms this would include time and space complexity analysis.
Every bottleneck may lead to a trade-off.
1. Implement or provide more specifics on the most suitable solution given picked trade-offs.

In case of requirements change, start from the beginning.
